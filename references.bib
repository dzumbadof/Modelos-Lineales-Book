abstract = {Demography comprises concepts and techniques for studying human populations. Demographic techniques measure rates of birth, death, internal and international migration, classified by age and sex. Demographic models analyze different regimes of population change for past and future population structures, defined mathematically and applied numerically to measure or project population change. Examples include the life table and the cohort–component projection model, which can be used with single or multiple populations. To account for historical changes in demographic components, theories have been proposed to explain how and why demographic regimes change. The past century has seen the first demographic transition, which accounts for a process whereby population mortality, fertility, and growth rates fall dramatically. The second demographic transition involves the persistence of below-replacement fertility in developed societies. The third demographic transition occurs when prolonged low fertility leads to population aging, resulting in gaps in labor supply, which are filled by immigration. Demography in geography covers population definitions and characteristics, formal models, sources of population data, processes of demographic change and associated indicators, models for projecting the population, and implications for societies across the globe. Most demographic analysis examines countries; some investigates spatial variations within countries, at regional, local, or neighborhood scale.}
